Hi, everyone !
This is an exercise to familar with Github.
It's too strange...I wish your support whenever i will face with hurdle..
I think this gihub is as a new communication methodology to talk about intangible things with others.
There are some limit to describe new concept with legacy languages. 
It's also difficult to represent that through any pictures. 
At this situation, it's very useful to communicate with other using Github for new concept.
